## General Information

*This project aims to classify images of skin lesions into nine different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

*Background: Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Early and accurate detection of skin cancer can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment.

*Business Problem: The primary goal is to create a model that can assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer quickly and accurately, thereby improving patient outcomes.

*Dataset: The dataset used in this project consists of images of skin lesions, divided into nine categories. The data is split into training and validation sets, with each class of skin lesions stored in separate subdirectories.


## Technologies Used

*Python 3.x
*TensorFlow 2.x
*Keras
*Matplotlib
*NumPy


## Conclusions

*The CNN model successfully classifies skin lesions into nine different categories with reasonable accuracy.

*Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, width and height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip, are effective in improving model performance and preventing overfitting.

*Training with a well-structured dataset and proper data augmentation can lead to significant improvements in model accuracy.

*Further tuning and experimentation with different model architectures and hyperparameters can potentially enhance the model's performance even more.
